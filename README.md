# Multi-Treatment Uplift Evaluation on Non-Random Assignment Biased Data

This repository contains the execution codes needed to reproduce the experiments described in the article :
‘Multi-Treatment Uplift Evaluation on Non-Random Assignment Biased Data’.

The main objective is to propose a benchmark for evaluating the performance of uplift models in a multi-treatment framework, with data presenting a non-random assignment bias.
